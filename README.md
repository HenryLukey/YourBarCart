# YourBarCart
A website to check which cocktails you can make based on which ingredients you have. Built using JavaScript, React, Firebase, and TailwindCSS.

Try it out here: https://yourbarcart-3b871.firebaseapp.com/

Just input the ingredients you have by using the sidebar, looking within the categories or using the searchbar - then when you have the right ingredients the cocktails that can be made will appear within the "here's what you can make" section.

Currently there is only ~40 cocktails, more will be added in the future. The site is designed for desktop use.
